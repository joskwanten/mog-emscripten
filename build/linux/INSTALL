Dependencies:
 SDL
 SDL_image
 SDL_mixer
 SDL_sound

On Ubuntu you can get all necessary packages by typing:
 sudo apt-get install g++ make libsdl-image1.2-dev libsdl-mixer1.2-dev libsdl-sound1.2-dev

Copy the Makefile in the build/linux directory to the top directory.
(The one where there's all the subdirs, including 'sources')
From there you can 'make' and 'make install'.
